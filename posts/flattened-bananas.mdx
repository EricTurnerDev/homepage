         It's just dehydrated banana. Here's how to re-create it at home.

I used to get <ExternalLink href="https://www.traderjoesreviews.com/product/trader-joes-nothing-but-banana-flattened-reviews/">"Nothing But... Banana, Flattened"</ExternalLink>
every time I went to Trader Joe's. It's a simple-but-delicious snack, essentially a chewy banana fruit leather. Then
Trader Joe's discontinued it. ðŸ˜¢

A few years ago I bought a food dehydrator to dry out 3D printer filament, and it wasn't long before
my thoughts turned to making my own banana, flattened. My first attempt was a disaster, but after
tweaking my approach a few times I have a method that works well.

## What you'll need

You won't get far without a food dehydrator! I have <ExternalLink href="https://amzn.to/3P63kXj" rel="sponsored">this one from Amazon</ExternalLink>.
It was literally the cheapest one at the time that had an adjustable temperature, and was large enough to fit a spool of
3D printer filament.

You also need five very-ripe bananas, cooking spray vegetable oil, and some parchment paper.

## Steps

Spray the fruit-leather trays with cooking oil so the dried bananas don't stick to them.

Peel a banana, and place it on a tray.

Put a piece of parchment paper on top, and squish it down to about 1/8 inch to 1/4 inch thick.

Repeat with the other bananas. I can fit two-and-a-half bananas per tray.

Place the trays in the dehydrator, and turn it on to 135 degrees F (57 degrees C).

I leave them in for about 24 hours, and change the order of the trays several times throughout the day to get an even drying
(the tray closer to the heat source dries faster). Your time will vary based on your dehydrator, how thick the bananas are, etc. You'll know they are ready when they have a leathery
consistency and won't come apart when you try to lift them from the tray.

I have no idea how long they last, because I always eat them within a few days. ðŸ˜‹

Hopefully this helps you. If you make these, let me know how they turn out!
