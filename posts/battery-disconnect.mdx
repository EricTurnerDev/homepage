excerpt: There are plenty of examples of garage fires started by vintage cars. Whether it's caused
         by faulty wiring or rodents chewing through wiring insulation, if you have a vehicle in long-term storage you should
         disconnect the battery for safety.

Google "classic car fire", and you'll get plenty of search results of vintage cars burning
down in garages, some of them sparked by electrical problems in the cars themselves. If
you store a vehicle long-term (or <ExternalLink href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=afpnkCOsMFU">own a Jeep!</ExternalLink> 🤣)
you should disconnect the battery for safety.

You could get a wrench out each time to disconnect and connect it, but there's an
easier solution to prevent this that costs under $10 and only takes a few minutes to install.

I bought <ExternalLink href="https://amzn.to/3AuOi9J" rel="promoted">this switch on Amazon.com</ExternalLink>, and installed it in five minutes.

All you need is a 1/2" wrench. Disconnect the cable from the negative battery post,
and connect it to the end of the switch. Then attach the switch to the battery post. Done!

When I installed mine, I had to install it at a bit of an odd angle because the windshield
washer fluid reservoir is right next to the battery.

Twist the knob counterclockwise to disconnect the battery, and clockwise to connect it. It couldn't be simpler.

One downside to this on newer cars is that you will probably have to re-program your radio.

Don't let the smoke out,
