import MDSpinner from "react-md-spinner";

I'm developing this site using Next.js, with the blog content written in Markdown, so it's easier to
write than coding HTML for each post. I'm also using MDX, which lets me embed React components in the Markdown to make the
blog posts interactive.

For example, here's a `react-md-spinner` (it's exciting, I know):

<MDSpinner />

And here is an example of syntax highlighting for a few different [languages](https://rdmd.readme.io/docs/code-blocks):

```jsx
function hello(name) {
    console.log(`Hello, ${name}!`);
}
```

```json
{
   "language": "json"
}
```

```bash
echo "bash" | wc -c
```

The site is just getting started, so check back periodically for updates.
