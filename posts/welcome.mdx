import MDSpinner from "react-md-spinner";

I decided to create my personal website to do some writing, share some content, and to have a
development playground for trying out new web development technologies and techniques as well as
hosting options. Eventually you'll find information here about all kinds of topics: programming,
technology, hobbies, etc. Maybe even a rant or two. 😉

The technologies I chose to develop this site with are (for now):

- Next.js
- React
- Javascript (ECMAScript)
- Markdown and MDX (Markdown for React)
- Tailwind CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)
- Google fonts
- Hosting on Vercel
- Git and Github for source code control
- WebStorm for an IDE (Integrated Development Environment)

I'll learn TypeScript at some point and make the switch, but Javascript is fine for now.

One of the more interesting ones in that list is MDX. MDX lets me write my blog posts in Markdown (which is simpler than writing HTML)
but also lets me embed React components in the Markdown to make the posts more dynamic, and potentially
interactive.

For example, here's a `react-md-spinner`. It's exciting, I know:

<MDSpinner />

Here is an example of syntax highlighting for a few different [languages](https://rdmd.readme.io/docs/code-blocks):

```jsx
function hello(name) {
    console.log(`Hello, ${name}!`);
}
```

```json
{
   "language": "json"
}
```

```bash
echo "bash" | wc -c
```

These are just a couple of examples of the power of MDX, but the sky is the limit. The
site is just getting started, so check back periodically for updates.

That's it for now,
