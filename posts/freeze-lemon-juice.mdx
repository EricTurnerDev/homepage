Happy Independence Day!  This is just a quick post to show how I keep fresh-squeezed lemon juice around,
and avoid throwing out unused lemons.

First, get a silicone muffin pan or ice cube tray. I have <ExternalLink href="https://amzn.to/3R7qtdQ" rel="promoted">this one from Amazon</ExternalLink>,
but any silicone muffin or ice cube tray pan will do.

Next, squeeze the juice from your extra lemons. Hint: silicone is flexible, so it helps to place
it on a cookie sheet for support to transfer it to your freezer.

I like to squeeze one lemon per cup in the muffin
pan using <ExternalLink href="https://amzn.to/3uk5F8X" rel="promoted">this squeezer</ExternalLink>.

Once all of your lemons are squeezed, put the muffin pan in the freezer for a few hours.
Remove the frozen pucks of lemon juice, and place them in a plastic container or bag
to store in the freezer.

When you need fresh lemon juice, remove however many pucks of lemon juice you need,
put them in a mug, and microwave it for 30 to 45 seconds.

You'll always have fresh lemon juice for cooking, and you'll never have to wonder if
the juice in that plastic lemon container sitting in the door of your fridge is still
any good!

Bon app√©tit,
